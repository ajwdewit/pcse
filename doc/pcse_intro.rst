Background of PCSE
==================

Crop models in Wageningen
-------------------------

The `Python Crop Simulation Environment` was developed because of a need to re-implement crop simulation
models that were developed in Wageningen. Many of the Wageningen crop simulation models were originally developed in
FORTRAN77 or using the `FORTRAN Simulation Translator (FST)`. Although this approach has yielded high quality models
with high numerical performance, the inherent limitations of models written in FORTRAN is also becoming increasingly
evident:

* The structure of the models is often rather monolithic and the different parts are very tightly coupled.
  Replacing parts of the model with another simulation approach is not easy.

* The models rely on file-based I/O which is difficult to change. For example, interfacing with databases
  is complicated in FORTRAN.

* In general, with low-level languages like FORTRAN, simple things already take many lines of code and mistakes
  are easily made, particularly by agronomists and crop scientist that have limited experience in developing or
  adapting software.

To overcome many of the limitations above, the Python Crop Simulation Environment (PCSE) was developed. It provides
an environment for developing simulation models as well as a number of implementations of crop simulation models.
PCSE is written in pure Python code which makes it more flexible, easier to modify and extensible allowing easy
interfacing with databases, graphical user interfaces, visualization tools and numerical/statistical packages. PCSE has
several interesting features:

* Implementation in pure Python. The core system has a small number of dependencies outside the Python standard
  library. However many data providers require certain packages to be installed. Most of these can be automatically
  installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) (`SQLAlchemy`, `PyYAML`, `openpyxl`, `requests`) and in
  processing of the output of models is most easily done with `pandas` DataFrames.

* Modular design allowing you to add or change components relatively quickly with a simple but powerful approach
  to communicate variables between modules.

* Similar to FST, it enforces good model design by explicitly separating parameters, rate variables and state
  variables. Moreover PCSE takes care of the module initialization, calculation of rates of changes, updating
  of state variables and actions needed to finalize the simulation.

* Input/Output is completely separated from the simulation model itself. Therefore PCSE models can easily
  read from and write to text files, databases and scientific formats such as HDF or NetCDF. Moreover, PCSE
  models can be easily embedded in, for example, docker containers to build a web API around a crop model.

* Built-in testing of program modules ensuring integrity of the system

Why Python
----------
PCSE was first and foremost developed from a scientific need, to be able to quickly adapt models and test ideas.
In science, Python is a well established tool for implementing algorithms, visualization and explorative analysis
due to its clear syntax and ease of use. An additional advantage is that the C implementation of Python
can be easily interfaced with routines written in FORTRAN and therefore many FORTRAN routines can be reused by
simulation models written with PCSE.

Many packages exist for numeric analysis (e.g. NumPy, SciPy),
visualisation (e.g. MatPlotLib, Chaco), distributed computing (e.g. IPython, pyMPI) and interfacing with databases
(e.g. SQLAlchemy). Moreover, for statistical analyses an interface with R-project can be established through
Rpy or Rserve. Finally, Python is an Open Source interpreted programming language that
runs on almost any hardware and operating system.

Although PCSE was
developed for scientific purposes, it has already been implemented for tasks in production environments and has been
embedded in container-based web services. Finally, although PCSE was developed for C python, a stripped-down version
of PCSE can also run under IronPython making the integration with the .NET platform possible.

History of PCSE
---------------

Up until version 4.1, PCSE was called "PyWOFOST" as its primary goal was to provide a Python
implementation of the WOFOST crop simulation model.
However, as the system has grown it has become evident that the system can be used to implement, extend or
hybridize (crop) simulation models. Therefore, the name "PyWOFOST" became too narrow and the name Python Crop
Simulation Environment was selected in analog with the FORTRAN Simulation Environment (FSE).


Limitations of PCSE
-------------------

PCSE also has its limitations, in fact there are several:

* Speed: flexibility comes at a price; PCSE is considerably slower than equivalent models written in FORTRAN or
  another compiled language.

* The simulation approach in PCSE is currently limited to rectangular (Euler) integration with a fixed daily
  time-step. Although the internal time-step of modules can be made more fine-grained if needed.

* No graphical user interface. However the lack of a user interface is partly compensated by using PCSE with the
  `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ package and the `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_.
  PCSE output can be easily converted to a pandas `DataFrame` which can be used to display charts in an Jupyter
  notebook. See also my collection of notebooks with `examples using PCSE <https://github.com/ajwdewit/pcse_notebooks>`_
