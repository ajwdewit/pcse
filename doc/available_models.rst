Models available in PCSE
========================

The following table lists the models that are available in PCSE and can be imported from `pcse.models` package.

===================== =======================================================================================================
Model name             Description
===================== =======================================================================================================
Wofost72_PP            An implementation of WOFOST 7.2 for potential production scenarios.
Wofost72_WLP_FD        An implementation of WOFOST 7.2 for water-limited production scenarios with freely draining soils.
Wofost80_PP_beta       An implementation of WOFOST 8.0 for potential production scenarios including N/P/K dynamics
Wofost80_WLP_FD_beta   An implementation of WOFOST 8.0 for water-limited production scenarios including N/P/K dynamics
                       for freely draining soils.
Wofost80_NWLP_FD_beta  An implementation of WOFOST 8.0 for water-limited and nutrient-limited production scenarios
                       including N/P/K dynamics for freely draining soils.
LINGRA_PP              A LINGRA implementation for simulating potential production scenarios.
LINGRA_WLP_FD          A LINGRA implementation for simulating water-limited production scenarios with freely draining soils.
LINTUL3                An implementation of the LINTUL3 model for production scenarios under water-limited and nitrogen-
                       limited production scenarios.
FAO_WRSI               An implementation of the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index model. This re-uses components
                       from WOFOST to create a simpler approach which computes water requirements and water availability.
Wofost72_Phenology     The phenology modules from WOFOST 7.2 as a standalone model. This is purely for convenience as in
                       some cases running the phenology is sufficient and this is much faster then running the full
                       WOFOST model.
