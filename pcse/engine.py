"""The PCSE Engine provides the environment where SimulationObjects are 'living'.
The engine takes care of reading the model configuration, initializing model
components (e.g. groups of SimulationObjects), driving the simulation
forward by calling the SimulationObjects, calling the agromanagement
unit, keeping track of time and providing the weather data needed.

Models are treated together with the Engine, because models are simply
pre-configured Engines. Any model can be started by starting the Engine
with the appropriate configuration file. The only difference is that
models can have methods that deal with specific characteristics of a model.
This kind of functionality cannot be implemented in the Engine because
the model details are not known beforehand.

    :param parameterprovider: A `ParameterProvider` object providing model
        parameters as key/value pairs. The parameterprovider encapsulates
        the different parameter sets for crop, soil and site parameters.
    :param weatherdataprovider: An instance of a WeatherDataProvider that can

        in the section on agronomic management.

    `Engine` handles the actual simulation of the combined soil-
    crop system. The central part of the  `Engine` is the soil
    water balance which is continuously simulating during the entire run. In
    contrast, `CropSimulation` objects are only initialized after receiving a
    "CROP_START" signal from the AgroManagement unit. From that point onward,
    the combined soil-crop is simulated including the interactions between
    the soil and crop such as root growth and transpiration.
    
    Similarly, the crop simulation is finalized when receiving a "CROP_FINISH"
    signal. At that moment the `finalize()` section on the cropsimulation is
    executed. Moreover, the "CROP_FINISH" signal can specify that the
    crop simulation object should be deleted from the hierarchy. The latter is
    useful for further extensions of PCSE for running crop rotations.
    
    Finally, the entire simulation is terminated when a "TERMINATE" signal is
    received. At that point, the `finalize()` section on the water balance is
    executed and the simulation stops.

    **Signals handled by Engine:**
    
    `Engine` handles the following signals:
        * CROP_START: Starts an instance of `CropSimulation` for simulating crop
          growth. See the `_on_CROP_START` handler for details.
        * CROP_FINISH: Runs the `finalize()` section an instance of 
          `CropSimulation` and optionally deletes the cropsimulation instance.
          See the `_on_CROP_FINISH` handler for details.
        * TERMINATE: Runs the `finalize()` section on the waterbalance module
          and terminates the entire simulation.
          See the `_on_TERMINATE` handler for details.
        * OUTPUT:  Preserves a copy of the value of selected state/rate 
          variables during simulation for later use.
          See the `_on_OUTPUT` handler for details.
        * SUMMARY_OUTPUT:  Preserves a copy of the value of selected state/rate
          variables for later use. Summary output is usually requested only
          at the end of the crop simulation.
          See the `_on_SUMMARY_OUTPUT` handler for details.

        it will be called by providing the value as input.

        the call will be: `set_variable('LAI', 5.0)`. Internally, this call will
        search for a class method `_set_variable_LAI` which will be executed

    """Engine to mimic CGMS behaviour.

    The original CGMS did not terminate when the crop cycles was finished but instead continued with its
    simulation cycle but without altering the crop and soil components. This had the effect that after the
    crop cycle finished, all state variables were kept at the same value while the day counter increased.
    This behaviour is useful for two reasons:

    1. CGMS generally produces dekadal output and when a day-of-maturity or day-of-harvest does not coincide
       with a dekad boundary the final simulation values remain available and are stored at the next dekad.
    2. When aggregating spatial simulations with variability in day-of-maturity or day-of-harvest it ensures
       that records are available in the database tables. So GroupBy clauses in SQL queries produce the right
       results when computing spatial averages.

    The difference with the Engine are:

    1. Crop rotations are not supported
    2. After a CROP_FINISH signal, the engine will continue, updating the
       timer but the soil, crop and agromanagement will not execute their simulation cycles.
       As a consequence, all state variables will retain their value.
    3. TERMINATE signals have no effect.
    4. CROP_FINISH signals will never remove the CROP SimulationObject.
    5. run() and run_till_terminate() are not supported, only run_till() is supported.
