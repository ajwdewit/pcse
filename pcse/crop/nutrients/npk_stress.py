class NPK_Stress(SimulationObject):
    """Implementation of NPK stress calculation through [NPK]nutrition index.

    Stress factors are calculated based on the mass concentrations of N/P/K in
    the leaf and stem biomass of the plant. For each pool of nutrients, four
    concentrations are calculated based on the biomass for leaves and stems:
    - the actual concentration based on the actual amount of nutrients
      divided by the actual leaf and stem biomass.
    - The maximum concentration, being the maximum that the plant can absorb
      into its leaves and stems.
    - The critical concentration, being the concentration that is needed to
      maintain growth rates that are not limited by N/P/K. For P and K, the
      critical concentration is usually equal to the maximum concentration.
      For N, the critical concentration can be lower than the maximum
      concentration. This concentration is sometimes called 'optimal
      concentration'.
    - The residual concentration which is the amount that is locked
      into the plant structural biomass and cannot be mobilized anymore.

    The stress index (SI) is determined as a simple ratio between those
    concentrations according to:

    :math:`SI = (C_{a} - C_{r})/(C_{c} - C_{r})`

    with subscript `a`, `r` and `c` being the actual, residual and critical
    concentration for the nutrient.
    This equation is applied in analogue to N, P and K and results in the
    nitrogen nutrition index (NNI), phosphorus nutrition index (PNI) and
    Potassium nutrition index (KNI). Next, the NPK index (NPKI) is calculated
    as the minimum of NNI, PNI, KNI. Finally, the reduction factor for
    assimilation (NPKREF) is calculated using the reduction factor for
    light use efficiency (NLUE_NPK).

    **Rate variables**

    The rate variables here are not real rate variables in the sense that they are derived
    state variables and do not represent a rate. However, as they are directly used
    in the rate variable calculation it is logical to put them here.
