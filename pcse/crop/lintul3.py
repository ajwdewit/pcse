    LINTUL3 is a crop model that calculates biomass production based on intercepted photosynthetically
    active radiation (PAR) and light use efficiency (LUE). It is an adapted version of LINTUL2 (that simulates
    potential and water-limited crop growth), including nitrogen limitation. Nitrogen stress in the model is
    defined through the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI): the ratio of actual nitrogen concentration and critical
    nitrogen concentration in the plant. The effect of nitrogen stress on crop growth is tested in the model
    either through a reduction in LUE or leaf area (LA) or a combination of these two and further evaluated
    with independent datasets. However, water limitation is not considered in the present study as the
    crop is paddy rice. This paper describes the model for the case of rice, test the hypotheses of N stress
    on crop growth and details of model calibration and testing using independent data sets of nitrogen
    treatments (with fertilizer rates of 0 - 400 kgNha-1) under varying environmental conditions in Asia.
    Results of calibration and testing are compared graphically, through Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD),
    and by Average Absolute Deviation (AAD). Overall average absolute deviation values for calibration and
    testing of total aboveground biomass show less than 26% mean deviation from the observations though
    the values for individual experiments show a higher deviation up to 41%. In general, the model responded
    well to nitrogen stress in all the treatments without fertilizer application as observed, but between
    fertilized treatments the response was varying.

    Nitrogen demand, uptake and stress

    At sub-optimal nitrogen availability in the soil, nitrogen demand of the crop
    cannot be satisfied, which leads to sub-optimal crop nitrogen concentration. The
    crop nitrogen concentration below which a crop experiences nitrogen stress is
    called the critical nitrogen concentration. Nitrogen stress results in reduced
    rates of biomass production and eventually in reduced yields. Actual N content
    is the accumulated N above residual (which forms part of the cell structure).
    The critical N content is the one corresponding to half of the maximum. Nitrogen
    contents of these three reference points include those of leaves and stems,
    whereas roots are not considered since N contents of above-ground (green) parts
    are more important for photosynthesis, because of their chlorophyll content.
    However, calculation of N demand and N uptake also includes the belowground
    part.

        Leaf area development

        and a linear stage where it depends on the increase in leaf biomass (Spitters,
        1990; Spitters and Schapendonk, 1990). The death of leaves due to senescence
        that may be enhanced by shading and/or stress leads to a corresponding loss in
        leaf area. The specific leaf area is used for the conversion of dead leaf
        biomass to corresponding loss in leaf area. The death of leaves due to
        senescence occurs only after flowering and the rate depends on crop age
        (function adopted from ORYZA2000, Bouman et al., 2001). The excessive growth of
        leaves also result in death of leaves due to mutual shading. The death of leaves
        due to shading is determined by a maximum death rate and the relative proportion
        of leaf area above the critical LAI (4.0) (Spitters, 1990; Spitters and
        Schapendonk, 1990). The net rate of change in leaf area (dLAI/dt) is the
