        complex than just `getting` a variable, because often some other
        internal variables (checksums, related state variables) must be updated

        the model designer to implement the appropriate code to do the update.

        The implementation of `set_variable()` works as follows. First it will
        recursively search for a class method on the simulationobjects with the
        name `_set_variable_<varname>` (case sensitive). If the method is found,
        it will be called by providing the value as input.

        So for updating the crop leaf area index (varname 'LAI') to value '5.0',
        the call will be: `set_variable('LAI', 5.0)`. Internally, this call will
        search for a class method `_set_variable_LAI` which will be executed
        with the value '5.0' as input.
