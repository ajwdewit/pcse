            events_table:
            - 0.15: {irrigation_amount: 20}


    Each StateEventDispatcher is defined by an `event_signal`, an `event_state` (e.g. the model
    state that triggers the event) and a `zero condition`. Moreover, an optional name and an
    optional comment can be provided. Finally the events_table specifies at which model state values
    the event occurs. The events_table is a list which provides for each state the parameters that
    should be dispatched with the given event_signal.

    For finding the time step at which a state event occurs PCSE uses the concept of `zero-crossing`.
    This means that a state event is triggered when (`model_state` - `event_state`) equals or
    crosses zero. The `zero_condition` defines how this crossing should take place. The value of `zero_condition`
    can be:

    * `rising`: the event is triggered when (`model_state` - `event_state`) goes from a negative value towards
       zero or a positive value.
    * `falling`: the event is triggered when (`model_state` - `event_state`) goes from a positive value towards
       zero or a negative value.
    * `either`: the event is triggered when (`model_state` - `event_state`) crosses or reaches zero from any
       direction.

    The impact of the zero_condition can be illustrated using the example definitions above.
    The development stage of the crop (DVS) only increases from 0 at emergence to 2 at maturity. A StateEvent
    set on the DVS (first example) will therefore logically have a zero_condition 'rising' although 'either'
    could be used as well. A DVS-based event will not occur with zero_condition set to 'falling' as the value
    of DVS will not decrease.

    The soil moisture (SM) however can both increase and decrease. A StateEvent for applying irrigation (second
    example) will therefore be specified with a zero_condition 'falling' because the event must be triggered
    when the soil moisture level reaches or crosses the minimum level specified by the events_table. Note that
    if we set the zero_condition to 'either' the event would probably occur again the next time-step because
    the irrigation amount increase the soil moisture and (`model_state` - `event_state`) crosses zero again
    but from the other direction.

class AgroManager(AncillaryObject):
    """Class for continuous AgroManagement actions including crop rotations and events.

    See also the documentation for the classes `CropCalendar`, `TimedEventDispatcher` and `StateEventDispatcher`.

    The AgroManager takes care of executing agromanagent actions that typically occur on agricultural
    fields including planting and harvesting of the crop, as well as management actions such as fertilizer
    application, irrigation, mowing and spraying.

    The agromanagement during the simulation is implemented as a sequence of campaigns. Campaigns start on a
    prescribed calendar date and finalize when the next campaign starts. The simulation ends either explicitly by
    provided a trailing empty campaign or by deriving the end date from the crop calendar and timed events in the
    last campaign. See also the section below on `end_date` property.

    Each campaign is characterized by zero or one crop calendar, zero or more timed events and zero or more
    state events.
    The structure of the data needed as input for AgroManager is most easily understood with the example
    (in YAML) below. The definition consists of three campaigns, the first starting on 1999-08-01, the second
    starting on 2000-09-01 and the last campaign starting on 2001-03-01. The first campaign consists of a crop
    calendar for winter-wheat starting with sowing at the given crop_start_date. During the campaign there are
    timed events for irrigation at 2000-05-25 and 2000-06-30. Moreover, there are state events for  fertilizer
    application (event_signal: apply_n) given by development stage (DVS) at DVS 0.3, 0.6 and 1.12.

    The second campaign has no crop calendar, timed events or state events. This means that this is a period of
    bare soil with only the water balance running. The third campaign is for fodder maize sown at 2001-04-15
    with two series of timed events (one for irrigation and one for N application) and no state events.
    The end date of the simulation in this case will be 2001-11-01 (2001-04-15 + 200 days).

        Getting the last simulation date is more complicated because there are two options.

        **1. Adding an explicit trailing empty campaign**

        The first option is to explicitly define the end date of the simulation by adding a
        'trailing empty campaign' to the agromanagement definition.
        An example of an agromanagement definition with a 'trailing empty campaigns' (YAML format) is
        given below. This example will run the simulation until 2001-01-01::

            Version: 1.0
            AgroManagement:
            - 1999-08-01:
                CropCalendar:
                    crop_name: winter-wheat
                    variety_name: winter-wheat
                    crop_start_date: 1999-09-15
                    crop_start_type: sowing
                    crop_end_date:
                    crop_end_type: maturity
                    max_duration: 300
                TimedEvents:
                StateEvents:
            - 2001-01-01:

        Note that in configurations where the last campaign contains a definition for state events, a trailing
        empty campaign *must* be provided because the end date cannot be determined. The following campaign
        definition will therefore lead to an error::

            Version: 1.0

                    - 1.12: {N_amount: 21, N_recovery: 0.7}


        **2. Without an explicit trailing campaign**

        The second option is that there is no trailing empty campaign and in that case the end date of the simulation
        is retrieved from the crop calendar and/or the timed events that are scheduled. In the example below, the
        end date will be 2000-08-05 as this is the harvest date and there are no timed events scheduled after this
        date::
