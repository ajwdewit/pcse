        The water balance in the model does not deal with a flooded rice system, but the 
        soil is maintained at saturation so that the crop does not experience water 
        stress. The soil water balance is calculated for a single soil layer, whose 
        thickness increases with downward root elongation. The model does not simulate 
        root elongation, but only average root increase in depth. The assumption that 
        the root elongation does not depend on the dryness of the soil until wilting 
        point is originally from LINTUL1 (Spitters, 1990). In the rice situation, we 
        have a saturated soil and the wilting point is not expected occur. Water and 
        nutrient uptake by the crop is limited to the rooted soil depth. Addition of 
        water to the available store through root extension is calculated from the rate 
        of extension and the (saturated) water content (Spitters and Schapendonk, 1990; 
        Farr� et al., 2000). 
        
        Nitrogen supply from soil 
        
        Mineral nitrogen available for crop uptake (TNSOIL) originates from three 
        sources: nitrogen present in the soil profile at germination/transplanting, 
        nitrogen from biological fixation and mineralization from soil organic matter 
        during the growing season and nitrogen applied as fertilizer. Under aerobic 
        conditions, indigenous soil nitrogen supply can be quantified reasonably 
        accurately on the basis of soil organic matter content (Sinclair and Amir, 
        1992). Under anaerobic conditions, however, differences in mineral N supply 
        between fields or seasons could not be explained on the basis of soil organic 
        carbon, total nitrogen or initial inorganic nitrogen (Cassman et al., 1996; 
        Bouman et al., 2001). Hence, indigenous nitrogen supply is introduced as a 
        site-specific exogenous input, rather than simulating nitrogen mineralization. 
        Ten Berge et al. (1997) found indigenous nitrogen supply values for tropical 
        soils in the range of 0.5�0.9 kg ha-1 d-1. Fertilizer nitrogen available for 
        plant uptake, taking into account possible losses due to volatilization, 
        denitrification, and leaching, is included in the model as a variable fraction, 
        named nitrogen recovery fraction, NRF. A low N recovery value in flooded rice 
        systems (30�39%, Cassman et al., 1996) is mainly due to volatilization losses. 
        Any form of inorganic nitrogen (NH4 + or NO3 -) when available in free form, if 
        not taken up by the crop, is vulnerable to loss either through volatilization, 
        denitrification or leaching. On a daily basis, the average N recovery value 
        would be more or less stable under flooded conditions. The variable NRF used in 
        the model represents the net recovery fraction of applied fertilizer, which 
        depends on soil type, development stage of the crop, fertilizer type and time 
        and mode of nitrogen application (De Datta, 1986) is determined by calibration.
